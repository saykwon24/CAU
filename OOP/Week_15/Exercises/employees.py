## This module defines an employee class hierarchy for payroll processing.

## An employee has a name and a mechanism for computing weekly pay.
#
class Employee:
    ## Constructs an employee with a given name.
    # @param name the name of the employee
    #
    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name
    
    
    ## Gets the name of this employee.
    # @return the name
    #
    def getName(self):
        return self._name
    
    
    ## Computes the pay for one week of work.
    # @param hoursWorked the number of hours worked in the week
    # @return the pay for the given number of hours
    #
    def weeklyPay(self, hoursWorked):
        raise NotImplementedError("Must override this method in subclass method")



## An hourly employee is paid for every hour worked.
#
class HourlyEmployee(Employee):
    ## Constructs an hourly employee with a given name and hourly wage.
    # @param name the name of this employee
    # @param wage the hourly wage
    #
    def __init__(self, name, wage):
        super().__init__(name)
        self._hourlyWage = wage
    
    
    # Overrides the superclass method.
    def weeklyPay(self, hoursWorked):
        pay = hoursWorked * self._hourlyWage
        if hoursWorked > 40:
            # Add additional pay for overtime
            pay = pay + ((hoursWorked - 40) * 0.5) * self._hourlyWage
        
        return pay
    


## A salaried employee is paid the same amount independent of the hours worked.
#
#
class SalariedEmployee(Employee):
    ## Constructs a salaried employee with a given name and annual salary.
    # @param name the name of this employee
    # @param salary the annual salary
    #
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        super().__init__(name)
        self._annualSalary = salary
    
    
    # Overrides the superclass method.
    def weeklyPay(self, hoursWorked):
        WEEKS_PER_YEAR = 52    # 1 year == 52 weeks
        return self._annualSalary / WEEKS_PER_YEAR    # monthly wage



## A manager is a salaried employee who also receives a bonus.
#
class Manager(SalariedEmployee):
    ## Constructs a manager with a given name, annual salary, and weekly bonus.
    # @param name the name of this employee
    # @param salary the annual salary
    # @param bonus the weekly bonus
    #
    def __init__(self, name, salary, bonus):
        super().__init__(name, salary)
        self._weeklyBonus = bonus
    
    
    # Overrides the superclass method.
    def weeklyPay(self, hoursWorked):
        return super().weeklyPay(hoursWorked) + self._weeklyBonus
        #return self._annualSalary / 52 + self._weeklyBonus    # DON'T DO LIKE THIS
